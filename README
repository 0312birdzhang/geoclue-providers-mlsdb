This geoclue plugin provides position updates based upon cell tower
signal strength data.  It looks up the location of nearby cell towers
from the Mozilla Location Services Database file which is shipped
on the device, and does a crude triangulation to determine the
likely position of the device.

To get debug output from the plugin, run it via:
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true" /usr/libexec/geoclue-mlsdb
